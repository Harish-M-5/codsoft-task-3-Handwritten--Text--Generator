# ✍️ Handwritten Text Generation using Character-Level RNN
### CodSoft Machine Learning Internship – Task 3

---

## 📌 Description
This project implements a **character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to generate handwritten-like text patterns.  
The model is trained on a handwritten text dataset and learns sequential character dependencies to generate new, realistic text outputs.

This project is developed as part of the **CodSoft Machine Learning Internship – Task 3**.

---

## 📖 Introduction
Handwriting is a unique human expression that reflects emotions, personality, and creativity.  
In this project, a Machine Learning model is trained to understand handwritten text patterns at the character level and generate new text that mimics handwritten writing style.

---

## 🔍 Overview
- Uses **character-level RNN**
- Trained on handwritten-style text dataset
- Generates new text based on learned character patterns
- Integrated with a **Streamlit frontend** for interactive and colorful UI
- Beginner-friendly and internship-ready implementation

## 📄 handwritten.txt (Dataset Explanation)
The `handwritten.txt` file contains handwritten-style English text.  
This text acts as the training data for the RNN model.

- Data is **plain text**
- No images required
- Model learns **character-by-character patterns**
- More text → better generation quality

Example:
Dear friend,
This letter is written slowly with care and patience.
Handwriting reflects emotions and thoughts.

## 🔁 RNN Explanation
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to process **sequential data**.

Why RNN?
- Maintains memory of previous characters
- Learns dependencies between characters
- Ideal for text generation tasks

In this project, RNN predicts the **next character** based on previous characters.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

1. **Embedding Layer**
   - Converts characters into dense vectors

2. **SimpleRNN Layer**
   - Learns sequential character dependencies

3. **Dense Layer**
   - Predicts the next character from vocabulary
